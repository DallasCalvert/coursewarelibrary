# Lab: Manage disks and volumes in Windows Server

## Scenario

Your manager has asked you to add disk space to a file server that is running Windows Server. This server will potentially grow significantly in size in the upcoming months and you might need flexibility in your storage options. You also have been asked to create a new virtual hard disk and optimize the cluster and sector size to accommodate large file sizes for storage on Hyper-V-based virtual machines. 

## Objectives

- Create and manage volumes
- Resize volumes
- Manage virtual hard disks

## Estimated time: 40 minutes

## Exercise 1: Create and manage volumes

### Scenario

In the test lab, you start by creating a number of volumes on the installed hard disks. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a hard disk volume and format for ReFS.
1. Create a mirrored volume.

### Task 1: Create a hard disk volume and format for ReFS

1. On **LON-SVR1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

3. To list all the available disks that have yet to be initialized, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Get-Disk | Where-Object PartitionStyle –Eq "RAW"
   ```

   > Notice that there are nine disks that are offline and not initialized.

4. To initialize disk 2, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Initialize-disk 2
   ```

5. To review the partition table enter, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Get-disk
   ```

   > All disks are now displayed. Disk 0, 1, and 2 are Online.

6. To create a Resilient File System (ReFS) volume by using all available space on disk 2, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   New-Partition -DiskNumber 2 -UseMaximumSize -AssignDriveLetter | Format-Volume -NewFileSystemLabel "Simple" -FileSystem ReFS
   ```

7. On the taskbar, select **File Explorer**. Notice that a new volume named Simple has been created.

   > **Question**: Which drive letter has been assigned to the newly created Simple volume? 
   >
   > **Answer**: Answers might vary, but it is assumed to be drive F. 

### Task 2: Create a mirrored volume

1. Right-click or access the context menu for **Start**, and then select **Disk** **Management**.

2. In the lower half of the Disk Management window, scroll down and right-click or access the context menu for **Disk 3**, and then select **Online**. 

3. Right-click or access the context menu for **Disk 4**, and then select **Online**. 

4. Close and reopen **Disk Management**.

5. In the **Initialize Disk** dialog box, select **OK** to initialize Disks 3 and 4.

6. On Disk 3, right-click or access the context menu for **Unallocated**, and then select **New Mirrored Volume**.

7. In the **New Mirrored Volume** wizard, select **Next**.

8. On the **Select Disks** page, in the **Available** list, select **Disk 4**, and then select **Add >**.

9. In the **Select the amount of space in MB** box, accept the default value, and then select **Next**. 

10. On the **Assign Drive Letter or Path** page, in the **Assign the following drive letter** box, select **M**, and then select **Next**. 

11. On the **Format Volume** page, in the **Volume label** text box, enter **MIRROR**.

12. Select the **Perform a quick format** check box, and then select **Next**. 

13. Select **Finish** to create the mirrored volume. 

14. In the **Disk Management** message box, select **Yes** to convert both disks to dynamic disks.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you will have successfully created volumes using PowerShell and Disk Management.

## Exercise 2: Resizing volumes

### Scenario

You create a new volume, and then realize that you must resize it. You decide to use Diskpart.exe to complete this process.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a simple volume and resize it.
1. Shrink a volume.

### Task 1: Create a simple volume and resize it

1. Switch to **Windows PowerShell ISE**. 

2. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Initialize-disk 5
   ```

3. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Start-Process Diskpart
   ```

   > A separate command prompt window opens to run Diskpart.

4. At the Diskpart command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   List disk
   ```

5. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Select disk 5
   ```

6. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Convert dynamic
   ```

7. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Create volume simple size=10000 disk=5
   ```

8. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Assign letter=z
   ```

9. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Format
   ```

10. Switch to **Disk Management**. 

    > Notice the NTFS volume on **Disk 5** of size approximately **10** gigabytes (GB). 

11. Switch to the Diskpart command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

    ```
    Extend size 10000
    ```

12. Switch to **Disk Management**.

    > Notice that the NTFS volume on **Disk 5** is now approximately **20** GB in size.
    >

### Task 2: Shrink a volume

1. Switch to the Diskpart command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Shrink desired=15000
   ```

2. Switch to **Disk Management**. 

3. Verify the presence of an NTFS volume on **Disk 5** of size approximately **5** GB. 

4. Close all open windows on LON-SVR1.


### Results

After completing this exercise, you will have successfully resized a volume.

## Exercise 3: Managing virtual hard disks

### Scenario

You need to create and configure a virtual hard disk for use in Windows Server Hyper-V. The virtual hard disk is for the Sales department. You will use Windows PowerShell to achieve these objectives. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a virtual hard disk.
1. Reconfigure the virtual hard disk.

### Task 1: Create a virtual hard disk

1. Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**. 

2. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   New-VHD -Path c:\sales.vhd -Dynamic -SizeBytes 10Gb | Mount-VHD -Passthru |Initialize-Disk -Passthru |New-Partition -AssignDriveLetter -UseMaximumSize |Format-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -Confirm:$false -Force
   ```

### Task 2: Reconfigure the virtual hard disk

1. To dismount the virtual hard disk, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Dismount-vhd C:\Sales.vhd
   ```

2. To check the properties of the virtual hard disk, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Get-vhd C:\Sales.vhd
   ```

   > **Question**: What is the physical sector size? 
   >
   > **Answer**: Answers will vary, but it is likely to be 512. 

3. To convert to a .vhdx file, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Convert-VHD –Path C:\Sales.vhd –DestinationPath c:\Sales.vhdx
   ```

4. To change the sector size, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Set-VHD –Path c:\Sales.vhdx –PhysicalSectorSizeBytes 4096
   ```

5. To check the properties of the .vhdx file, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Get-vhd C:\Sales.vhdx
   ```

   > **Question**: What is the physical sector size? 
   >
   > **Answer**: Answers will vary, but it is likely to be 4096. 

6. To optimize the .vhdx file, at the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter: 

   ```
   Optimize-VHD –Path c:\Sales.vhdx –Mode Full
   ```

### Results

After completing this exercise, you will have successfully created and managed virtual hard disks by using Windows PowerShell.
