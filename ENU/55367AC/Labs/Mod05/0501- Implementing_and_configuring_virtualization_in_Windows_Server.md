# Lab: Implement and configure virtualization in Windows Server

## Scenario

Contoso recently deployed a Windows Server 2022 server and client infrastructure. Because of many Contoso's physical servers are underutilized, you plan to expand virtualization to optimize the environment, and you want to perform a proof of concept to validate how you can use Hyper-V to manage a virtual-machine (VM) environment. 

The Contoso DevOps team also wants to explore container technology to determine whether it can help reduce deployment times for new applications and simplify moving applications to the cloud. You'll work with the DevOps team to evaluate Windows Server containers and whether to provides Internet Information Services (IIS) web services in a container.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Create and configure VMs.
- Install and configure containers.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Exercise 1: Creating and configuring VMs

### Exercise scenario

In this exercise, you use Hyper-V Manager and Windows Admin Center to create and configure a VM. You'll start with creating a private virtual network switch, and then you'll create a differencing drive of a base image that's already been prepared with the operating system (OS) to be installed on the VM. Finally, you'll create a generation 1 VM that uses the differencing drive and private switch that you've prepared for the proof of concept.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Create a Hyper-V virtual switch.
1. Create a virtual hard disk (VHD).
1. Create a VM.
1. Manage VMs by using Windows Admin Center.

## Exercise 2: Installing and configuring containers

### Exercise Scenario

In this exercise, you'll use Docker to install and run Windows containers, and then use Windows Admin Center to manage containers.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Install Docker on Windows Server.
1. Install and run a Windows container.
1. Use Windows Admin Center to manage containers.

### Task 1: Install Docker on Windows Server

1. On **LON-ADM1**, from the taskbar, open **Microsoft Edge**.
1. On the **Favorites** bar, select **Windows Admin Center**.
1. In the Windows Security box, enter the following credentials:

   - User name: **Contoso\\Administrator**
   - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
1. On the **All connections** page, select **LON-SVR1.Contoso.com**.
1. On the **Specify your credentials** page, select **Use another account for this connection**. Provide the **Contoso\\Administrator** credentials, and then select **Continue**.
1. In the **Tools** list, select **PowerShell**. Provide the **Contoso\\Administrator** credentials, and then select **Enter**. You're now connected to **LON-SVR1** using a Remote PowerShell connection.

   > **Note:** The PowerShell connection in **WAC** might be slow because of nested virtualization that's used in the lab. A recommended alternative method is to use **Enter-PSSession -computername LON-SVR1** from a PowerShell window on **LON-ADM1**.

1. At the PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force
   ```

1. At the **NuGet Provider** prompt, enter **`Y`** for yes, and then select Enter.
1. At the PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```
   Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
   ```

1. At the confirmation prompt, enter **`A`** for Yes to All, and then select Enter.

1. After the installation is complete, restart the computer by using the following command:

   ```
   Restart-Computer -Force
   ```

### Task 2: Install and run a Windows container

1. After **LON-SVR1** restarts, reconnect the PowerShell tool, and then provide the **Contoso\\Administrator** credentials.

1. Verify the installed version of Docker by using the following command:

   ```
   Get-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
   ```

   > **Note:** You might need to run **Start-Service -name Docker** before running the next commands.

1. To verify whether any Docker images are currently pulled, use the following command:

   ```
   Docker images
   ```

   > Notice that there are no images in the local repository store.

1. To review Docker base images from the online repository, use the following command:

   ```
   Docker search Microsoft
   ```

   > Notice the variety of base images, each representing various runtime scenarios. You might need to run the command twice to obtain the list.
   >

1. To download a server-core image, with IIS, that matches the host OS, run the following command:

   ```
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2022
   ```

   > **Note:** This download might take more than 15 minutes to complete.

1. To confirm the Docker image that's currently pulled, use the following command:

   ```
   Docker images
   ```

   > Notice that there's now an image listed in the local repository store.

1. To run the container, enter the following command:

   ```
   Docker run -d -p 80:80 --name ContosoSite mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2022 cmd
   ```

   > This command runs the IIS image as a background service (-d) named ContosoSite and configures networking such that port 80 of the container host (**LON-SVR1**) maps to port 80 of the container.

1. Enter the following command to retrieve the IP address information of the container host:

   ```
   ipconfig
   ```

   > Note the IPv4 address of the Ethernet adapter named vEthernet (nat). This is the new container's address. Make a note of the IPv4 address of the Ethernet adapter named **Ethernet**, which is the IP address of the host (**LON-SVR1**).

1. In Microsoft Edge, open another tab, and then enter **```http://172.16.0.12```**. 

   > Observe the default IIS page provided by IIS running in the Docker container.

1. In the remote PowerShell session, enter the following command:

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

   > This command provides information on the container that's currently running on LON-SVR1. Take note of the container name, as you'll use it to stop the container.

1. In the remote PowerShell session, enter the following command:

     ```
     docker stop ContosoSite
     ```

1. Rerun the `docker ps` command to confirm that the container has stopped.

### Task 3: Use Windows Admin Center to manage containers

1. On **LON-ADM1**, ensure that **LON-SVR1** is targeted in the Windows Admin Center, and then select the **Containers** tool.
1. Browse through each of the **Overview**, **Containers**, **Images**, **Networks**, and **Volumes** tabs.

### Results

After this exercise, you'll have installed Docker on Windows Server and installed and run a Windows container that has web services.
