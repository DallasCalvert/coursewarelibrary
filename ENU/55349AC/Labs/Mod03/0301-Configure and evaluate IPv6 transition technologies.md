# Lab: Configure and evaluate IPv6 transition technologies

## Lab scenario

Contoso Corporation has recently purchased several key applications that support IPv6. As a result, you are considering integrating IPv6 on the internal network. To test various IPv6/IPv4 integration strategies, you have configured a test network environment between the three main company locations. You need to configure and test IPv6 connectivity by using various integration technologies.

The layout of the completed test environment is shown as follows.

![The illustration depicts the computers that are configured in this lab. LON-DC1 and LON-SVR1 are located on the lower-left side of the illustration, and represent IPv6-capable hosts located in the same subnet as the IPv6-capable network. TOR-SVR1 is located at the upper-right corner of the illustration, and represents an IPv6 host located on a different subnet, which is also IPv6-capable. The Internet is represented as a cloud in the upper-left corner of the illustration. The Internet connection is IPv4-only. EU-RTR is in the middle, which represents a router that connects the two subnets and the Internet connection.](./Media/Mod03_Infrastructure.gif)

## Exercise 1: Review the default IPv6 configuration

### Scenario

To understand how IPv6 works and how the planned infrastructure changes will affect network traffic, you first must identify and document the default IPv6 configuration at Contoso Corporation. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Identify the default IPv6 configuration.

2. Test link-local address connectivity.

### Task 1: Identify the default IPv6 configuration

1. Sign in to **LON-DC1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **DNS**.

3. In the **DNS** console tree, expand **LON-DC1\\Forward Lookup Zones**, and then select **Contoso.com**. 

   > Notice that **LON-DC1** has one IPv6 address preconfigured for the lab. There are no AAAA records registered for any other computer.

4. Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell**.

5. At the **Windows PowerShell** command prompt, enter **`ipconfig`**, and then press Enter. 

   > Notice that this command returns a link-local IPv6 address. Take note of this address. As you may recall, the prefix for link-local addresses is always `FE80::/64`.

6. Enter **`Get‑NetIPAddress`**, and then press Enter. 

   > Notice that this command also returns a link-local IPv6 address. 

7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 on **LON-SVR1** and **TOR-SVR1**. Sign in to both servers as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**

   > **Note:** Windows client and server operating systems do not register link-local IPv6 addresses in DNS.

### Task 2: Test link-local address connectivity

1. Switch to **LON-DC1**.

2. At the **Windows PowerShell** command prompt, enter **`ping`**, followed by the **LON-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address, and then press Enter.

   > **Note:** The **LON-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address was displayed in step 5 of the previous task. When typing the IPv6 address, do not enter the percent sign (%) and do not enter the numbers after the %. Four successful replies should be displayed.
3. At the **Windows PowerShell** command prompt, enter **`Test-NetConnection`** followed by the **LON-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address, and then press Enter.

   > **Note:** The **LON-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address was displayed in step 5 of the previous task. When typing the IPv6 address, do not enter the percentage symbol (%) and do not enter the numbers after the %.
   >
   > **`Ping Succeeded: True`** from the **LON-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address should be displayed. The **`Test-NetConnection`** cmdlet performs diagnostics for a network connection and displays the results. The results also include a diagnostic message to notify you of whether the **ping** command was successful.
4. 
   At the **Windows PowerShell** command prompt, enter **`Test-NetConnection`** followed by the **TOR-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address.

   > **Note:** The **TOR-SVR1** link-local IPv6 address was displayed in the previous task. When typing the IPv6 address, do not enter the percentage sign (%) and do not enter the numbers after the %.
   >
   > The following should be displayed: The warning message **`DestinationHostUnreachable`**, and the result of the diagnostics that displays the message **`Ping Succeeded: False`**. This is because the link-local IPv6 addresses are not routable and can be used for communication only on local subnet.

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have reviewed the default IPv6 configuration and test how computers communicate by using link-local IPv6 addresses.

## Exercise 2: Implement DHCPv6

### Scenario

Contoso Corporation is planning to implement IPv6 throughout its internal network. To manage the IPv6 addresses assigned to clients, you need to configure DHCP to assign the IPv6 addresses.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create and configure DHCPv6 scopes.
2. Verify configuration by testing allocation of IPv6 addresses.

### Task 1: Create and configure DHCPv6 scopes

1. On **LON-DC1**, in the **Server Manager** window, select **Tools**, and then select **DHCP**.

2. In the **DHCP** console, expand **lon-dc1.Contoso.com**, expand **IPv6**, select and then right-click **IPv6**, and then select **New Scope**.

3. In the **New Scope Wizard**, select **Next**.

4. On the **Scope Name** page, in the **Name** text box, enter **Headquarters** **IPv6**, and then select **Next**.

5. On the **Scope Prefix** page, in the **Prefix** text box, enter **`fd00:0000:0000:0000::`**, and then select **Next**.

6. On the **Add Exclusions** page, enter the following, select **Add**, and then select **Next**: 

   Start IPv6 Address: **`0000:0000:0000:0000`**
   End IPv6 Address: **`0000:0000:0000:00ff`**

7. On the **Scope Lease** page, select **Next**.

8. On the **Completing the New Scope Wizard** page, select **Finish**.

9. Close the DHCP console.


### Task 2: Verify configuration by testing allocation of IPv6 addresses

1. Switch to **LON-CL1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Select **Start**, enter **PowerShell**, and then press Enter.

3. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, enter **`Ipconfig /renew6`**, and then press Enter.

4. Verify that the IPv6 address is in the IP range `FD00::/64`.

**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have configured DHCP to assign IPv6 addresses, and verified that the addresses are assigned correctly.

## Exercise 3: Configuring network integration by using ISATAP

### Scenario

The first option for testing IPv4 to IPv6 integration is to implement an ISATAP router. You need to configure an ISATAP router and verify that users can connect to other subnets by using IPv6.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

   ```
   dnscmd /info /globalqueryblocklist
   
   dnscmd /config /globalqueryblocklist wpad 
   ```

   > This step reviews the content of the global query block list and then removes the name **ISATAP** from the list.

2. In the **DNS** console tree, right-click **LON-DC1**, point to **All Tasks**, and then select **Restart**.

3. In the **DNS** console tree, expand **LON-DC1**, and then expand **Forward Lookup Zones**.

   ```

10. Enter the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```
   Get-NetIPAddress | Format-Table InterfaceAlias,InterfaceIndex,IPAddress
   ```

11. Record the **InterfaceIndex** of the ISATAP interface that is assigned to the **London_Network**. (IPv6 address contains 172.16.0.1)

12. Enter the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```
    Get-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex *IndexYouRecorded* -PolicyStore ActiveStore | Format-List
    ```

13. Verify that forwarding is enabled for the interface and that advertising is disabled.

14. The ISATAP interface for an ISATAP router must have forwarding enabled and advertising enabled. enter the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```

   >
   > This is a 6to4 address that **EU-RTR** automatically assigns based on the public IPv4 address **131.107.0.10**, which is assigned to the **Internet** interface.
   >
   > **Note:** Note the IPv6 address of the **6to4** adapter where, **`836b:a`** in the hexadecimal system corresponds to **131.107.0.10**. That is:
   >
   > **83** hexadecimal = **131** decimal
   > **6b** hexadecimal = **107** decimal
