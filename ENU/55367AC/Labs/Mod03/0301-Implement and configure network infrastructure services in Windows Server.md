# Lab: Implement and configure network infrastructure services in Windows Server

## Lab scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a large organization with complex requirements for network services. To help meet these requirements, you will deploy and configure DHCP so that it is highly available to ensure service availability. You will also set up DNS so that Trey Research, a department within Contoso, can have its own DNS server in the testing area. Finally, you will provide remote access to Windows Admin Center and secure it with Web Application Proxy.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Deploy and configure DHCP
- Deploy and configure DNS

## Exercise 1: Deploy and configure DHCP

### Scenario

The Trey Research subdivision of Contoso, Ltd. has a separate office with only about 25 users. They have been manually configuring IP addresses on all of their computers and want to use DHCP instead. You will install DHCP on **LON-SVR1** with a scope for the Trey Research site. Additionally, you will configure DHCP Failover for high availability with **LON-DC1**.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Install the DHCP role.
1. Authorize the DHCP server.
1. Create a scope.
1. Configure DHCP Failover.
1. Verify DHCP functionality.

### Task 1: Install the DHCP role

1. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, select **Windows Admin Center**.

   > **Note:** It may take a minute or two for the Windows Admin Center services to start.

1. In the **Windows Security** dialog box, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, select **lon-svr1.contoso.com**.

   > **Note:** You can ignore any warning message regarding the update extension catalogs.

1. In the **Specify your credentials** dialog box, select **Use another account for this connection**, and then sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. On the **Tools** pane, select **Roles & features**.

1. In the **Roles and features** pane, select the **DHCP Server** check box, and then select **Install**.

1. In the **Install Roles and Feature**s dialog box, select **Yes**.

   > **Note:** You can select the **Notifications** icon to monitor and verify the current status.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, select the **Server Manager** drop-down menu, and then select **All connections**.

1. Select **lon-svr1.contoso.com**.

1. On the **Tools** pane, select **Overview**, and then on the details pane take note of the message to reboot LON-SVR1. 

     > The message might take a while to display, continue with the next steps regardless.

1. On the details pane select **Restart**. Windows Admin Center returns to the **All connections** page.

    > **Note:** Wait 3-4 minutes for **LON-SVR1** to restart.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, if necessary, select the **Server Manager** drop-down menu, and then select **All connections**.

1. Select **lon-svr1.contoso.com**.

1. On the **Tools** pane, select **DHCP**, and then on the details pane, select **Install**. 

     > If DHCP is not available in the **Tools** pane for **LON-SVR1**, close **Microsoft Edge** and sign in to **Windows Admin Center** again.

1. Wait for a notification that the **DHCP PowerShell tools** are installed. If necessary, select the **Notifications** icon to verify the current status. Select **Close** to close the **Notifications** page.

### Task 2: Authorize the DHCP server

1. On **LON-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Server Manager**.
1. In **Server Manager**, select **Notifications** in the menu, and then select **Complete DHCP configuration**.
1. In the **DHCP Post-Install configuration wizard** window, on the **Description** screen, select **Next**.

## Exercise 2: Deploy and configure DNS

### Scenario

The staff who work at the Trey Research location within Contoso need to have their own DNS server to create records in their test environment. However, their test environment still needs to be able to resolve internet DNS names and resource records for Contoso.com. To meet these needs, you are configuring forwarding to your internet service provider (ISP) and creating a conditional forwarder for ```contoso.com``` to **LON-DC1**. There is also a test application that needs a different IP address resolution based on user location. You are using DNS policies to configure ```testapp.treyresearch.net``` to resolve differently for users at the head office.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Install the DNS role.
1. Create a DNS zone.
1. Configure forwarding.
1. Configure conditional forwarding.
1. Configure DNS policies.
1. Verify DNS policy functionality.

### Task 1: Install the DNS role

1. On **LON-ADM1**, on the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, select **Windows Admin Center**.

   > Note: If **DNS** is not available in the **Tools** pane for **LON-SVR1**, close **Microsoft Edge** and sign in to **Windows Admin Center** again.

1. Wait until a notification appears indicating that the **DNS PowerShell tools** are installed. If necessary, select the **Notifications** icon to verify the current status.

### Task 2: Create a DNS zone

1. On **LON-ADM1**, in **Windows Admin Center**, ensure that the **DNS** node is selected.

1. Select **Actions** and then select **Create a new DNS zone**.

1. In the **Create a new DNS zone** dialog box, enter the following information, and then select **Create**:

    ```powershell
    Resolve-DnsName -Server LON-svr1.contoso.com -Name LON-dc1.contoso.com
    ```

    > Notice that the DNS server on LON-SVR1 can resolve the LON-DC1.Contoso.com name to IP address 172.16.0.10.

1. Close the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window.

### Task 5: Configure DNS policies

1. On **LON-ADM1**, in Windows Admin Center, while connected to **LON-SVR1.contoso.com**, select the **PowerShell** node.
1. At the **Password** prompt, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then select **Enter**.
1. To create a head office subnet, enter the following, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    Add-DnsServerClientSubnet -Name "HeadOfficeSubnet" -IPv4Subnet "172.16.0.0/24"
    ```

1. To create a zone scope for head office, enter the following, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell

    ```

1. Close **Windows Admin Center**.

### Task 6: Verify DNS policy functionality

1. On **LON-CL1**, select **Start**, and then enter **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

1. Select **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

1. At the **Windows PowerShell** prompt, enter **`ipconfig`**, and then select **Enter**. 

    > Note that the Ethernet adapter has an IP address that is part of the HeadOfficeSubnet (172.16.0.0) configured in the policy.

1. To test the DNS policy, at the Windows PowerShell prompt enter the following command and then press Enter:

     **```Resolve-DnsName -Server LON-svr1.contoso.com -Name testapp.treyresearch.net```** 

    > The name resolves to the IP address **172.30.99.100** that was configured in the HeadOfficePolicy.

1. Select **Start**, and then select **Settings**.

1. In the **Settings** window, select **Network & internet**, and then select **Advanced network settings**.

1. Select **More network adapter options**.

1. In **Network Connections**, right-click or access the context menu for **Ethernet**, and then select **Properties**.

1. In the **Ethernet Properties** dialog box, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**, and then select **Properties**.

1. In the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties** dialog box, select **Use the following IP address**, enter the following information, and then select **OK**:
    - IP Address: **172.16.11.100**
    - Subnet mask: **255.255.0.0**
    - Default gateway: **172.16.0.1**
    - Preferred DNS server: **172.16.0.10**

1. Select **Close** twice.

1. To test the DNS policy, at the **Windows PowerShell** prompt, enter the following, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     Resolve-DnsName -Server LON-svr1.contoso.com -Name testapp.treyresearch.net
     ```

1. Notice that the name resolves to **172.30.99.234** because the client is no longer in the HeadOfficeSubnet location.

1. Close all open windows.

     > **Note:** When the client is on HeadOfficeSubnet **(172.16.0.0/24)** the record `testapp.treyresearch.net` resolves to **172.30.99.100**. When the client is moved off of HeadOfficeSubnet, ```testapp.treyresearch.net``` resolves to **172.30.99.234**.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have successfully installed and configured the DNS server role to support name resolution, forwarding, and DNS policies.
