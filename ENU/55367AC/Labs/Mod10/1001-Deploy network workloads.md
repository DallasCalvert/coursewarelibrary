# Lab: Deploy network workloads

## Scenario

The employees in the IT department at Contoso need to be able to access server systems outside of business hours to correct issues that arise during weekends or holidays. Some of the employees are using computers that aren't members of the contoso.com domain. Other users are running non-Windows operating systems on their computers. To enable remote access for these users, you will provide remote access to Windows Admin Center and secure it with Web Application Proxy and deploy a secure VPN solution using the SSTP VPN protocol.

Your company is preparing to deploy a new intranet web application on an internal web server. You need to verify the server configuration and install IIS. The website must be accessible using a friendly DNS name and all web connections to and from the server must be encrypted.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Deploy and configure Web Application Proxy
- Implement a VPN in Windows Server
- Deploy and configure a web server

## Estimated time: 90 minutes
