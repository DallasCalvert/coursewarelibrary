# Implement Hyper-V Replica and Windows Server Backup

## Scenario

You work as an administrator at Contoso, Ltd. Contoso wants to assess and configure new disaster recovery and backup features and technologies. As the system administrator, you have been tasked with performing that assessment and implementation. You decide to evaluate **Hyper-V Replica** and Windows Server Backup.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Configure and implement **Hyper-V Replica**.
- Configure and implement backup with Windows Server Backup.

## Estimated time: 45 minutes

## Exercise1: Configure and Implement Hyper-V Replica

### Scenario

Before you start with a cluster deployment, you have decided to evaluate the new technology in Hyper-V for replicating VMs between hosts. You want to be able to manually mount a copy of a VM on another host if the active copy or host fails.

The main tasks for this exercise are to:

1. Configure a replica on two host machines.
1. Configure VM replication.
1. Validate a failover.

### Task 1: Configure a replica on two host machines

1. On **LON-ADM1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. Select **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell ISE**. 

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   $cred=Get-Credential
   ```

1. When prompted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     $sess = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName LON-svr1.contoso.com
     ```

1. Next, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession $sess
   ```

   > You should get a [`LON-svr1.contoso.com`] title in your command prompt. From this point, all the commands that you enter run on **LON-SVR1**.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

   > You'll receive the properties of this firewall rule. Search for the value of the *Enabled* variable. It should be set to **False**. To enable **LON-SVR1** as a replication host, you must enable this firewall rule.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enable-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

   > You'll receive the properties of this firewall rule. Search for the value of the *Enabled* variable. Now it should be set to **True**.

1. To configure **LON-SVR1** as a Replica server for **Hyper-V Replica**, enter the following command in the PowerShell window, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-VMReplicationServer -ReplicationEnabled $true -AllowedAuthenticationType Kerberos -ReplicationAllowedFromAnyServer $true -DefaultStorageLocation c:\ReplicaStorage
   ```

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    Get-VMReplicationServer
    ```

    > You should get the configuration setting that you configured in the previous step, which is as follows:
    >
    > - **RepEnabled:True**
    > - **AuthType:Kerb**
    > - **KerAuthPort:80**
    > - **CertAuthPort:443**
    > - **AllowAnyServer:True**

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     Get-VM
     ```

     > **LON-CORE1** should be listed as a virtual machine (VM) that's configured on this Hyper-V server. Leave the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window open.

1. Select **Start**, and then enter **Windows PowerShell ISE**. This will open another instance of Windows PowerShell ISE.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     $cred=Get-Credential
     ```

1. When prompted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     $sess1 = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName LON-svr2.contoso.com
     ```

1. Next, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     Enter-PSSession $sess1
     ```

     > You should get a [`LON-svr2.contoso.com`] title in your command prompt. From this point, all commands that you enter run on **LON-SVR2**.

1. Repeat steps 7 through 12 in the PowerShell ISE window where you have a session opened on **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**. This will configure **LON-SRV2** for **Hyper-V Replica**. 

     > In step 12, you should get no result when running the **Get-VM** command because no VMs are configured on **LON-SVR2**.

1. Leave both PowerShell sessions open for the next task.

### Task 2: Configure VM replication

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enable-VMReplication LON-CORE1 -ReplicaServerName LON-SVR2.contoso.com -ReplicaServerPort 80 -AuthenticationType Kerberos -computername LON-SVR1.contoso.com
   ```

1. After you have verified that you didn't receive any error message from the previous command, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMInitialReplication LON-CORE1
   ```

   > This starts the initial replication process for VM **LON-CORE1**, from **LON-SVR1** to **LON-SVR2**.

1. After you have verified that you didn't receive any error message from the previous command, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VMReplication
   ```

   > This command retrieves the replication status.
>
   > In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **InitialReplicationInProgress**. Wait for 4&ndash;5 minutes, and then repeat this command. Verify that the value in the **State** column is **Replicating**. Don't proceed to the next steps until you get this value. Additionally, ensure that **Primary server** is set to **LON-SVR1** and **ReplicaServer** is set to **LON-SVR2**.

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   get-vm
   ```

   > Verify that you now have the **LON-CORE1** VM on **LON-SVR2**. This means that the VM successfully replicated.

1. Leave both Windows PowerShell sessions open for the next task.

### Task 3: Validate a failover

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMFailover -Prepare -VMName LON-CORE1 -computername LON-SVR1.contoso.com
   ```

   When prompted, select **Yes to All**. This command prepares for the planned failover of **LON-CORE1** by replicating any pending changes.
1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMFailover -VMName LON-CORE1 -computername LON-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   When prompted, select **Yes to all**. This command fails over the replica VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-VMReplication -Reverse -VMName LON-CORE1 -computername LON-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   > This command switches the replica VM to a primary VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have the remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VM -VMName LON-CORE1 -computername LON-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   > This command starts the VM that has been switched from a replica VM to a primary VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VM
   ```

   > In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **Running**.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VMReplication
   ```

   > In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **Replicating**. Additionally, ensure that the **Primary server** is now set to **LON-SVR2** and that **ReplicaServer** is set to **LON-SVR1**.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Stop-VM LON-CORE1
   ```

1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following commands, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Exit-PSSession
   Remove-PSSession $sess
   ```

1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`LON-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following commands, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Exit-PSSession
   Remove-PSSession $sess1
   ```

1. Close both PowerShell windows.

>**Note:** If you want to verify the results of this exercise by using GUI tools, you can start Hyper-V Manager on **LON-ADM1**, and then add the **LON-SVR1** and **LON-SVR2** servers to the **Hyper-V** console. You can then verify that the **LON-CORE1** VM exists on both **LON-SVR1** and **LON-SVR2** and that replication is running from **LON-SVR2** to **LON-SVR1**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured **Hyper-V Replica** and tested failover.
